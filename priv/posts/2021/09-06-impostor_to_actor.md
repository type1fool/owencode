## Practice

Before I landed my first full-time development gig, I had gained _just_ enough confidence to start applying for roles that seemed a little out of reach. The internet was full of horror stories about technical interviews, and I recognized that interviewing for positions was its own skill.

There were a couple interviews where I progressed, but found that my skills were not aligned with the needs of the organization. Still, I approached these interviews as practice, a form of [exposure therapy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exposure_therapy) if you will. Fortunate to have stable employment, the stakes were lower than in past interviews, and this practice mindset dialed down the pressure on myself considerably. When I didn't land a job, it wasn't the last opportunity, and I was able to hone the skill of being interviewed.

## Patience

Later, when an internal job opening surfaced, I had more coding and interviewing experience. The previous year, I had met part of the team through participation in an innovation contest. I didn't win, but the process allowed me to show off some technical skills, and it introduced me to my future manager. Throughout the process, I was aware that a door was opening and I needed to at least place one foot into the doorway.

A year had passed between that competition and the opening for which I was ultimately hired. This was frustrating because I truly felt I had made good impressions and had discussions with leaders about my future plans. So, when I received the alert about the opening, it was maybe just in time for my morale.

## Doubt

The first few months on the team, I was reacquainted wth impostor syndrome. Looking at the projects and systems I would be maintaining, it felt like I had made a big mistake. What I've learned since is that it is quite common, especially when transitioning careers.

Even experienced developers will ancounter impostor syndrome from time to time. As I learned to identify it, I was also able to see how my relative lack of experience could actually benefit the team in some unexpected ways.

## Inquisitiveness

Sometimes it just helps to have a fresh set of eyes. The problems and technical deby you've been avoiding can be glaring and painful to newcomers. Since I had been learning to code in the modern era, I had picked up skills and opinions that I was able to express with growing confidence. Sharing ideas can be stressful, but approaching the team with respect and care will make for productive conversations.

This first development role was an excellent and formative experience. I quickly learned that nobody knew everything. The enterprise organization was large and complex enough that I would hear others ask questions that I felt too embarassed to raise myself. Speaking up is a skill I had learned in previous roles, and with time I gained confidence to ask for clarification when I didn't understand something.

One big takeaway was that if I have a question, I'm not the only one. Listening to experienced engineers express frustration about complex systems and opaque documentation, I was reminded that asking questions, even venting, was useful for everyone involved. Some of the best conversations have happened after asking what felt like a stupid question. This is true even in most interviews.

## Refinement

At the end of the day, questions and critiques are important forms of communication that convey not only _your_ sense of confusion, but it gives others cover to raise similar concerns. It also helps to highlight areas where documentation and training can be improved.

Remember this:

> You were hired for a reason!

If you need help, ask for it. Every time I expected condescension for asking a question, I have been relieved and impressed by the kindness of my peers. I hope you find the same in your career.
