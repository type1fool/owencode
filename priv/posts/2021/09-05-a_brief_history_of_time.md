## Dawn of Time

Every software developer has their own story. Some learned to code in childhood, some later in school, and others learned later in life. For me, the journey had fits and starts, and it's not exacly a template for anyone else's success. It's also true that engineering is not a career for everyone.

That said, when I started to seriously persue software development as a career, I was feeling the limitations of my career path at the time. In a customer care organization, the career path typically leads to management. While I had a short stint as a retail manager, there was nothing appealing to me about managing care teams. I have a lot of respect for the leadership in the care org, but it just wasn't a role where I would thrive.

## A New Horizon

So, around 2015 I signed up for a few Javascript courses online and started consuming hours of coding content on YouTube. It helped that I had learned HTML thanks to a pioneering middle-school teacher in 1997. It also helped that I had been introduced to resources like CSS Tricks in the wild days of customizable MySpace profiles.

Like many people, I learn best when there is a project I can use for practice. I had adopted a simple bookmarks file project, and wanted to make it fancy, so Javascript was the next language to learn.

## A Black Rabbit Hole

What followed was a rabbit hole of technologies. Often it was overwhelming. As I was learning Javascript, I heard about React. As I learned React, I heard repeatedly about _functional programming_ and _immutable data_. Searching for these terms quickly lead me to a new language with _very_ passionate advocates, Elixir.

This, of course, is only scratching the surface of technologies I learned along the way. By the time I applied to my first full-time developer positions, I had built and maintained a custom note-taking/checklist application using VueJS and TailwindCSS; I had refactored some legacy Bootstrap and PHP code; and I had preliminary (and naive) plans for a multi-tenant role-based authorization system.

## Into the Wreckage

Here, I could talk about some of the technical frustrations I encountered in my first role as a full-stack engineer. However, my time in customer service taught me to search deeper for root causes. Once an acute technical problem is solved, what caused it in the first place, and how can it be prevented in the future?

As for my diagnosis, the root causes of the problems I encountered were:

- Insufficient standards
- Insufficient communication
- Insufficient time

Most challenges I face ultimately point back to these causes.

As a team player, I wanted to make a positive impact on the team's productivity. I had learned in previous years to speak up, even when it felt risky. Credit to peers I observed and leaders who listened.

Change, though, is a tough pill to swallow for some. My ideas and suggestions were often met with silence or frustration, and I had to adapt to the personalities on the team. Without years of customer service experience, I might not have handled these challenges the same way.

## Building the Rocket

Having learned some hard lessons about change in enterprise, I set out to address those root challenges using tools already available in the organization. This involved investigating frameworks for PHP and Python, building prototypes, onboarding the team to use cloud infrastructure, OAuth, and other components. Along the way, I always had Elixir and Phoenix in mind as the gold standard for long-term maintainability.

Though I was compromising on the tech stack, I was picking up useful skills that would eventually propel me to the next level of my career.

## A New Dimension

As long as COVID doesn't get in the way, I will be attending my first developer conference in October, ElixirConf 2021. After years of watching talks on YouTube, listening to various Elixir and non-Elixir podcasts, and ocassional interactions online, I can finally meet people in the community and form some new friendships. I got a taste of this at local Elixir meetups around 2018-2019, and it will be an exciting week. ðŸ¤ž

Another new dimension would be [fly.io](fly.io). owencode.com was previously hosted on Netlify, as it was a basic HTML page with Javascript and ThreeJS for fun 3D stuff. Now, owencode.com is a Phoenix application built using [JosÃ© Valim's approach](https://dashbit.co/blog/welcome-to-our-blog-how-it-was-made) to building the Dashbit blog. At the time of writing, it's deployed to a single region, but Fly is special in that multi-region deployment is vastly simplified compared to the alternatives.

Great job, Fly!
