As I write this, I am a gainfully employed, full-time software developer at a Ruby & Elixir agency, SmartLogic. On this day after Thanksgiving, taking stock of the past few years, there may be no better time to start cataloging my thoughts. My path to this point has been long and winding, and perhaps a bit unlikely.

I want to offer encouragement to anyone who has an impossible dream that A) it's worth fighting for, B) you deserve to make your dream real, and C) you must be the one to fight for it.

Here's my story.

## Early Days

My introduction to code of any kind was eighth grade class where the teacher was introducing HTML as a way to build a class website. No Javascript, no CSS; frames and GIF buttons ruled the day. Everything was hand-coded. I would dabble with Flash later, then Processing, then Android Studio, then I would give up. During this time, my future was geared more towards making music and whatever jobs would support that. A few years at the local radio and television station, a few years in retail, temporary jobs; all of these were means to a end of making music.

As my passion for creativity was dwindling, I spent more time gaming and consuming content. I eventually had a stable full-time job at a Comcast call center, which paid the bills and came with the benefits crucial to surviving.

## That Itch Must Be Scratched

At some point, an opportunity arose to take over a simple HTML project that used Javascript for some features. Before, I had struggled to learn anything code-related aside from HTML and CSS. This project was the opportunity I needed to tinker with something, learn how it worked, and make it better.

It can be easy to forget how challenging it is for newcomers to understand terms like _strings_, _integers_, _floats_, _arrays_, _objects_, and _functions_. Courses from Treehouse and Wes Bos were very helpful for understanding this new vocabulary while teaching how to solve problems with tools like Javascript and PHP. As I learned, I rebuilt the project I had adopted from scratch. The code became dry-er and the user interface received a significant facelift. I was lucky to be tackling this while Javascript was getting some major improvements.

This project became a useful way to demonstrate my ambition as I interviewed for internal positions, eventually landing a transfer to a more advanced troubleshooting team. Once I was there, I saw a need for standardization, so I took the opportunity to create a proof of concept application which was adopted and maintained throughout my time on the team. Although software development wasn't in my title, I saw a need, communicated with leadership about my idea, and gained buy-in. As opportunities would arise to work on this application, it was becoming increasingly clear to me that this was something I should pursue professionally. The intermittent opportunities to work on it were my driving force.

## Levelling Up

Building confidence to switch careers isn't easy. My second project had been working well, solving the problem I set out to solve. However, it's hard to know if two small closed-source projects are enough experience to make the leap to a more formal role. I applied to a handful of internal and external openings over a year or two, even getting a few interviews. Keeping my expectations low, I considered these practice interviews. I was hopeful, but I would have been truly shocked if I was hired to any of those early positions.

It took a few attempts and a good dose of luck, but I eventually landed a full-time software engineering role internally at Comcast. The year before, I had participated in a contest that introduced me to leaders within the organization, one who would turn out to be my next manager.

In the year that passed between that contest and the actual job posting, I had almost lost hope. It felt like I had set aside all of my hobbies to pursue a dream that wasn't going to come to fruition. Fortunately, my teammates were supportive and provided the encouragement I needed until the perfect job was posted. Long story short, I got the job and learned as much as I could over the next two years.

## Soft Skills >= Hard Skills

As unlikely as my path may have been, I do believe it provided communication skills which are sometimes lacking in engineering teams. Working in retail and call centers, I had to learn how to interact with customers with varying levels of knowledge, patience, forthrightness, and anger. I could have become an engineer without these skills, but they've helped me approach sensitive conversations with empathy, assertiveness, and clarity.

My first two years as an engineer also taught me to ask more questions. Even with questions which felt embarrassing to ask, I was never rebuked. This may be a point of privilege, though I've certainly been ridiculed for not knowing something in other environments. The teams I worked with were diverse and inclusive, and the culture was increasingly open-minded.

Now, when I come across a problem I don't understand, I know to ask questions and to ask them early. Forming the question can be difficult, so it's often fair to simply state "I'm confused about ___" and let the other person clarify. Great can answers come from questions like this.

## A Post-Transition Transition

After a couple years in my first engineering role, I had an urge to work with different tools on different problems. There seemed to be ever increasing opportunities in the Elixir ecosystem where I wanted to work, and I found a chance to join an excellent team at SmartLogic. A few interviews later, I accepted an offer and turned in my two week notice at Comcast. I had started as an entry-level customer service representative and was leaving as a confident full-time full-stack engineer.

## Congregation

My tickets to ElixirConf 2021 were purchased months in advance, and it was planned as my last vacation of the year. With the transition to SmartLogic, this week at the conference suddenly became an introduction to some of the new folks I would be working with. It would have been a thrilling week anyway, but these introductions and time spent with my new peers was invaluable. Instead of fighting imposter syndrome, I was able to relax and get to know the rest of the team before diving into the first project.

Typically, there is no opportunity to meet your new team in a low-stakes environment the week before you officially start. Meetups, forums, and open source contributions may be the next-best way to build connections in the community.

## What's Next

After thoroughly enjoying my first ElixirConf in October 2021, I left the conference refreshed with ambitions for doing something new with Elixir. Inspired by the people I interacted with that week, I had a vague idea that I too would want to present a talk someday.

The next weekend, I had an idea.

That is what I will be writing about next. Stay tuned.
